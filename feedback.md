### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 2 related models** (more if they make sense!) – one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
* **Include sign up/log in functionality**, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow, Keep this simple, we want you focusing on the logic of the app.
* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process.
* Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS**
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public
* (were going to teach you how to deploy on heroku)

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application, built by you, that contains all of the RESTful routes, full CRUD**
* *Bonus*: hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.
* **A `README.md` file** with explanations of the technologies used, what problem your app solves/why you made it, the approach taken, installation instructions/requirements, contributor information, unsolved problems, forthcoming features, etc. The README.md should  also include
 * (links to) **Wireframes of your app**, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
 * (a link to) **User stories you created**

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

The above key will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!




## Project Workflow - 3

Excellent work with your project workflow! Your project’s repository had plenty of development branches for source control management / a detailed README / plenty of commit history. You also included user stories and wireframes in your README per the project 2 prompt and requirements. In addition to this, I also observed the use of a todo list for project management as well, so excellent work, once again everyone!`


## Technical Requirements - 3

You all did amazing work for this project! You’ve met all of the technical requirements and then some. You also exceeded the technical requirements by adding additional complexity to your models and you’ve added passport / oauth2 as a stretch goal! Again, you you all did a superb job exceeding expectations!

## Creativity - 3

You blew the creativity portion for this project out of the water everyone! I really appreciate your additional efforts to style your templates as well. This was by far one of the most creative apps I’ve seen for a Unit 2 project. Congratulations on meeting and exceeding all of the minimum requirements for creativity for project 2.

## Code Quality - 2

Overall, you project’s code quality was good. I’ve placed some detailed comments in your files as a means to offer suggestions to some improvements you could take advantage of.

The biggest suggestion I would offer it to explore VS Code beautify. This a a tool inside of VS code that allows you to have your code indented automatically using the VS Code IDE.

Here’s some information on VS Code Beautify

The next thing I would suggest would be to remove all commented out/non-functional code from your files to ensure good convention and sensibility to your custom modules...i.e. controllers/models..etc.

Also, its a good practice to make sure you’re not importing external modules into your files unless you’re using them.

Overall, you all did well, but these are some suggestions to make your code quality even better.
Again, make sure you’re checking out the comments I’ve place inside of each of your individual files.

## Deployment - 3

Excellent work in getting your project deployed everyone! You also went through the extra steps to custom name your project’s URL in heroku!

## Total 14/15

Excellent work for this project everyone! You all should be very proud! You all make a great team together, and once you get out into the industry, you might find that more difficult to come by at times.

You all have grown so much in these first two units, and I look forward to seeing your future projects!
